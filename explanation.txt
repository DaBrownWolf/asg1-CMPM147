I used the OnPeak feature from p5. It allowed me to map my particle system to the beat of the music. If a peak was encountered that fit within a certain threshhold, then the ParticleSystem created a circle of particles. This essentially mimics a ripple effect. I did not use any other features, as I had to do a lot of learning just to get this one feature down. If I had more time, I might have used one more feature from p5.
